Reddit Thread

Aim for something simple with longevity

Use for alternate tunings and not just tuning

Tremolo/vibrato functionality?

Polyphonic?

**Solution pathways**

Number of strings tuned at once

**Polyphonic capability**

**Multiple motors**

Automated / **Manual Strumming**

If manual, one vs multiple strums

Control system to lock in pitch

User Interface / Display?

Maybe, especially if we want the user to be able to set the pitches (alt tuning?)

**Automated** / Manual Motor Control

Flexibility with different guitar brands / headstocks

Probably not

Safety considerations / limitations

Use as a tuner or on-the-fly alternate tuning adjuster

Portability / ease of attaching and removing

Weight?

Battery life?

### Custom PCB stuff

Has to have a processor (stm32 probably)

Breadboard design first

Donâ€™t forget microcontroller programmer

FILL THE Gaps

find which H bridge to use
