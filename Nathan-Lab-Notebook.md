# ECE 445 Lab Notebook

## Week 1

### (1/21/2025)
- Partered with Ethan Lin (ethanl7)
- Started brainstorming Automatic Guitar Tuner idea
  - Initial idea is to use a microphone, hammer, and motor system to be able to detect and automatically tune each guitar string
  - By using a hammer system (similar to a piano), we would be able to detect each string's frequency in real-time and tune based on that without any work required from the user
 
### (1/23/2025)
- Feeback from Professor: How is this automatic guitar tuner differ from the ones already on the market?
- Feedback from TAs: How are we going to differentiate from past ECE 445 Guitar Tuner projects?

## Week 2

### (1/28/2025)
- Began implementing project idea feedback:
  - We can use a vibration sensor instead of a microphone to eliminate outside noise from affecting the tuning process
  - We can tune all 6 strings at once instead of one at a time to make the overall tuning process more efficient

### (1/29/2025)
- Completed Labratory Safety Training
- Concerned about the hammer system as it might be tough to find hammers that can fit on all 6 strings --> Might just have the user strum all 6 strings at once a couple of times but that then requires user action

### (1/30/2025)
- Completed CAD Assignment
- Settled on not using the hammers as it would make the build very awkward to set up --> User instead strum all 6 strings (can be seen as interactive)

## Week 3

### (2/4/2025)
- Began drafting RFA document
  - Our project will have 4 subsystems: the power subsystem, the motor subsystem, the processing subsystem, and the vibration-sensing subsystem
  - We decided to use a Piezo Disc Transducer that will attach to and collect vibrational data from the body of the guitar
  - We need to create a specific algorithm to determine which string corresponds to which output frequency from
  - We want our entire system to run on a 9 volt battery as many guitarists already carry them around to power their guitar pickups
  - Note of Caution: Can't let the motors be too powerful such that they break the guitar (potentially torque-limited?)

### (2/6/2025)
- Finalized the details for the RFA document
  - We want to be able to tune each string to within 12 cents of the intended string frequency
- Current Parts List:
  - Power Subsystem:
    - 9V Battery
    - 5V Voltage Regulator (LM317T)
  - Motor Subsystem
    - Motors (ROB-11696)
    - H-Bridges (4489)
  - Processinfg Subsystem
    - Microcontroller (TBD)
  - Vibratio-Sensing Subsystem
    - Piezo Disc Transducer (DZS Elec 35mm)
    - Signal Amplifier (LM386N-1)

### (2/7/2025)
- Learned and improved upong soldering skills via the Soldering Assignment

## Week 4

### (2/10/2025)
- Began drafting Project Proposal to prepare for the TA meeting
  - Created Initial Block Diagram: ![ECE 445 Initial Block Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1179d8e5-3d7b-453e-a700-23392906c309)
  - Decided that the guitar will always be tuned to the standard guitar tuning (EADGBE which has a general frequency range of 80Hz - 350Hz)
  - We will use an LED to indicate when the guitar has finished tuning
  - After looking closer at the Piezo Disc Transducer, we need one with a higher resonant frequency than the standard guitar tuning range as to interfere with any vibrational readings
    - Ours have a resonant frequency around 4.6kHz which is well outside the tuning frequency range

### (2/11/2025)
- Had 1st TA Meeting
  - Need to fully label all connections in the block diagram
  - Add a separate section for subsystem requirements that a more qualitative
  - Recommended us to refer to a Fall 2022 Project's Design Document for a good example ([CHARM](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece445/getfile.asp?id=20868))

### (2/13/2025)
- Added Subsystem Requirements Section to Project Proposal
  - We plan to power all subsystems at a constant 5V
  - Determined that the torque limit for the motors should be <= 0.5 N*m to prevent damage to the guitars
  - We will amplify the signal from the Piezo Disc Transducer by 20dB before sending it to the microcontroller for processing

### (2/14/2025)
- Completed Team Contract
  - Assigned task roles:
    - *Nathan Kim*: Software development, microcontroller programming, frequency analysis (FFT implementation)* 
    - *Ethan Lin*: Hardware design, motor control, circuit design (piezo amplifier, power regulation)*
    - *Shared Tasks*: System integration, testing, debugging, and final documentation
    - *We will split working on FFT implementation and circuit design based on real-time difficulties or challenges encountered along the way as they both are core parts of the project 

## Week 5

### (2/17/2025)
- Completed Peer Proposal Review (Automatic Card Shuffler)
- Decided to use the STM32H7B0RBT6 microcontroller ([Datasheet](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19480645/stm32h7b0rb.pdf)) 
  - Designed for high performance --> important for fast tuning algorithm
  - Includes a full set of DSP instructions
  - Built-in ADC and Motor Control pins
- Updated Project Proposal for the Proposal Review
  - The microcontroller runs at 3.3V so we need both a 3.3V and 5V Voltage Regulator
  - Updated Parts List:
    - Added 3.3 Voltage Regulator (AZ1117CD-3.3TRG1)
    - Replaced motors for a higher torque output (ROB-11696 --> GA12-N20)
  - Added a Battery Analysis of the entire system with the added/updated parts:
    | Component                   | Quantity | Voltage    | Current per Unit | Total Current |
    | --------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
    | STM32 Microcontroller       | 1        | 3.3V       | 100mA            | 100mA         |
    | L298N H-Bridge              | 3        | 5V         | 70mA             | 210mA         |
    | GA12-N20 Motors             | 6        | 5V         | 40mA             | 240mA         |
    | TXJ-055-US Piezo Transducer | 1        | N/A        | N/A              | N/A           |
    | LM386N-1 Amplifier          | 1        | 9V         | 8mA              | 8mA           |
    | LED Indicator               | 2        | 3.3V       | 10mA             | 20mA          |
    | AZ1117CD Voltage Regulator  | 2        | 9V-5V/3.3V | 10mA             | 20mA          |
    - Total Current Draw: 598mA
    - Average 9V Battery: 500mAh
    - Battery Life = $\frac{BatteryCapacity(mAh)}{TotalCurrentDraw(mA)} = \frac{500mAh}{598mA} \approx 0.83 hours$
      - Assuming it takes 1 minute to finish tuning, our system can be used up to 50 times from one 9V battery
  - Updated Block Diagram with full labeling: ![ECE 445 Block Diagram V2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cecf9ec-2bf3-41f9-a881-44dee75acd75)

### (2/19/2025)
- Completed Professor Proposal Review
  - Verify that readings from the Piezo Disc Transducer are accurate
  - Need to think more about the torque of the motors and how to properly limit it as to not break the guitar

## Week 6

### (2/25/2025)
- Vibration-Sensing Subsystem Experimentation and Testing
  - Tested Piezo Disc Transducer output using Scopy to verify accurate frequency readings
  - Determined that the transducer needs to be placed on the bridge of the guitar as the vibrations are the strongest there
  - Have to rethink the design for how to attach the transducer to the guitar as it can't really just cllp on to the bridge
  - Strumming all 6 strings at once does produce distinct frequency peaks but we need to differentiate between the root notes and harmonics when tuning
- Motor Subsystem Experimentation and Testing
  - Tested the motors to see if they can properly turn the tuning pegs
  - Ethan 3D printed motor-peg attachments to be able to fit around the tuning pegs
  - The current motors we have are too weak to turn the pegs
  - Need to look into stronger motors and may have to adjust subsystem voltage requirements

### (2/27/2025)
- Had 2nd TA Meeting
  - Can order parts through my.ece --> Purchasing Tab
  - Additional Feedback from Professor
    - Need to consider what sampling frequency we will use when reading from the Piezo Disc Transducer
    - What motor RPM would be optimal?
    - Block Diagram is too small/too busy
  - Obtained Kit 91 from Locker J1 (18-36-48)
 
### (2/28/2025)
- Decided to change which voltage regulators based on ECE supplies
  - Updated Parts List:
    - Replaced 3.3V Voltage Regulator (AZ1117CD-3.3TRG1 --> LM2937-3.3)
    - Replaced 5V Voltage Regulator (LM317T --> LM2937)
    - *The updated Battery Analysis remains essentially the same
      
## Week 7

    ![ECE 445 Block Diagram V3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16eff804-28c0-459e-9232-37d7f62de796)

### (3/5/2025)
- Picked up actual guitar we will be using for the project
  - Verified that the Piezo Disc Transducers still obtain accurate readings with this guitar
  - Need to adjust physical designs to accomodate the smaller guitar size
- Completed Teamwork Evaluation I
- Began looking into how to program STM32 Microcontroller ([STM32H7 User Guide](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19483219/STM32H7.User.Guide.pdf))

### (3/6/2025)
- Had 3rd TA Meeting
  - We should upload our PCB files to PCBWay for approval --> Then send the approval screenshot to the TA so he can also verify everything
- Finalized Design Document
  - Decided to use a magnetic mounting system to attach the Piezo Disc Transducer to the bridge of the guitar
  - Added a weekly schedule going forward:
    | Week      | Tasks                                                                                                                                      | Responsibility                           |

### (3/8/2025)
- Added key STM32 initialization functions
  - GPIO_Init --> For Motor Control and Control Buttons
  - PWM_Init --> For Motor Speed Control
  - ADC_Init --> For Piezo Disc Transducer Frequency Detection
  - UART_Init --> For general debugging features
  - *Currently unable to actually test any of these as our microcontroller still has not come in

## Week 8

### (3/10/2025)
- Began to develop basic tuning algorithm (written initially in Python for easier testing and debugging)
  - Obtained frequency output graphs from the Piezo Disc Transducer via Scopy
  - Given an in-tune guitar, we are able to categorize the frequency of each string when all 6 strings are strummed by filtering out the harmonics within a set tolerance value <br />
    <img width="463" alt="ECE 445 Python Script Output" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78c536eb-6195-4d7f-be35-e06daa009999" />
  - Still need further testing for out-of-tune guitars, especially if neighbor strings interfere with each other when they are severly out-of-tune
  - Full Script Available Here: [ECE 445 Frequency Analysis Script](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fa643Y6XStVupCan_778ElVVapWFxAj5?usp=sharing)

### (3/11/2025)
- Could not finish Breadboard Demo as our microcontroller arrived too late to attempt to program

## Week 9
- Spring Break

## Week 10

## (3/25/2025)
- Continued to fine tune the Frequency Analysis Script while the microcontroller was being soldered together for breadboard use and programmability
- Determined specific out-of-tune boundaries for the guitar such that each string can only be a whole step out-of-tune in either direction (Sharp or Flat)
  - This is so that there is no string tuning interference when looking specifically at the G3 and B3 string - with the whole step out-of-tune limit in place, in the worst case the G3 string will be Sharp up to an A3 and the B3 string will be Flat to an A3, both of which can be non-inclusive frequencies to prevent any overlap
  - The full list of string tuning boundaries is shown below:
    | Guitar String | Tuning Note Range | Tuning Frequency Range | Exact In-Tune Frequency |
    | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | 
    | E2            | D2 - F#2          | 73.42 Hz - 92.50 Hz    | 82.41 Hz                |
    | A2            | G2 - B2           | 98 Hz - 123.47 Hz      | 110 Hz                  | 
    | D3            | C3 - E3           | 130.81 Hz - 164.81 Hz  | 146.83 Hz               |
    | G3            | F3 - A3           | 174.61 Hz - 220 Hz     | 196 Hz                  | 
    | B3            | A3 - C#4          | 220.01 Hz - 277.18 Hz  | 246.94 Hz               |
    | E4            | D4 - F#4          | 293.66 Hz - 369.99 Hz  | 329.64 Hz               |

## (3/26/2025)
- Adjusted the Harmonic Reduction Algorithm such that the E2 string no longer removes the E4 string fundamental frequency
  - This is due to the nature of harmonics being integer multiples of each other
  - Ex. E2 fundamental frequency of 82.41 Hz with a 2nd and 3rd harmonic of 164.82 Hz and 329.64 Hz respectively (where 329.64 Hz also corresponds to the E4 string)

## (3/27/2025)
- Had 4th TA Meeting
  - 3rd Wave of PCB orders are due next Monday so we should let him know if/when we upload everything to PCBWay and it's approved
  - No major updates since the Breadboard Demo except minor advancements in the Frequency Analysis Script

## Week 11

### (3/31/2025)
- Developed a more detailed flowchart of how the Processing Subsystem/Tuning Algorithm will function
  - It can be broken down into three subtasks:
    - Transforming the output from the Vibration-Sensing Subsystem into a frequency spectrum
    - Determining the frequency of each string from the given frequency spectrum
    - Calculating how much each motor should turn based on a given stringâs frequency
<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c4c522f-c64a-406b-bce8-4c0d6d98f969" alt = "Sample Image" width = "700" height = "600">

### (4/1/2025)
- Determined the exact specifications of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that we'll use to obtain a frequency spectrum
  - Sampling Rate: 1024 Hz
  - Sample Size: 1024 Samples
  - Nyquist Frequency: 512 Hz
- Since the guitar tuning frequency range is 80 Hz - 330 Hz, a Nyquist frequency of 512 Hz will capture all of the necessary frequencies
- The frequency spectrum will have a granularity of 1 Hz
  - &Delta;f = fs / N where fs is the Sampling Rate and N is the Number of Samples

### (4/2/2025)
- Completed Individual Report
- Continued to adjust Frequency Analysis Script such that it now filters out cases where there may be multiple frequencies associated with a given string frequency bucket
  - Ex. If the D3 string bucket contains both the D3 fundamental frequency and an external source of noise, it will run a calculation to see which frequency is closest to the correct frequency and remove all others - thus, each string bucket will only have the one fundamental frequency to consider for tuning 

### (4/3/2025)
- Had 5th TA Meeting
  - Will likely have to make a few changes to the PCB for the 4th wave due next Monday
  - Discussed overall details of the Processing Subsystem/Tuning Algorithm flowchart
    - FFT details are solid but we need to look more into the motor rotation calculations

## Week 12

### (4/7/2025)
- Began to program the microcontroller now that it was soldered for Breadboard usage
  - Used a JTAG connector to flash the microcontroller with the following pinout
    | Pin Number | Description  |
    | ---------- | ------------ |
    | Pin 7      | NRST         |
    | Pin 45     | JTMS / SWDIO |
    | Pin 49     | JTCK / SWCLK |
    | Pin 50     | JTDI         |
    | Pin 55     | JTDO         |
  - Unfortunately unable to locate the chip as a programmable device
    - Maybe due to incorrect JTAG connections or messy soldering crossing pins
- Ordered a STM32 Nucleo-144 Dev board for easier testing and programming
  - Specifically chose this version of the dev board because it uses the STM32H753 microcontroller which is the same H7 Cortex as our actual microcontroller
  - So it'll hopefully be easy to port over all progess made on the dev board to our PCB design

### (4/9/2025)
- Looking closer at the motor control calculations, our original thoughts on the motor conflow flow is shown below
  1. Have the user strum the guitar once and note the frequency of each string
  2. Turn the motors 15 degrees either clockwise or counterclockwise based on whether the string was sharp or flat
  3. Have the user strum again after all the motors finished turning and note the new frequency of each string
  4. Create a linear interpolation of each string's frequency vs degree of rotation
  5. Use this interpolation to then calculate how much the turn each motor for future strums
- However, we realized that a string's frequency does not scale linearly with its tension
  - $f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{ \frac{T}{&mu;} }$ where L is the length of the string, T is the tension of the string, and &mu; is the mass per unit length of the string

### (4//10/2025)
- Had 6th TA Meeting
  - Talked with the TA about the new Dev board that we ordered
- Discussed possible alternative solutions for the motor control calculations
  - Could potentially do a ratio calculation since the amount each string is allowed to be out-of-tune by is a whole step in either direction which corresponds to about 180 degrees of rotation

## Week 13

### (4/15/2025)
- STM32 Nucleo-144 Dev board arrived
- Able to successfully locate and program the board
- Went through many video tutorials to set up the board and acheive basic program functionality
  - [STM32 Hello World Tutorial Guide](https://youtu.be/8S78Ih4SaiE?si=6Xj7R8O0bKv14Vj-)
  - [STM32 UART Guide](https://youtu.be/ttzu-j77jPg?si=z0fbmpthiJIxOkbx)
  - [STM32 ADC Single-Input Mode Guide](https://youtu.be/q2R8jqOQuj8?si=JdF-AFtofjSvF06V)
  - [STM32 ADC Differential Mode Guide](https://youtu.be/E47Alkv0Uko?si=PrPSLkQyITmeg1vr)
  - ^the piezoelectric sensor outputs a differential voltage signal
- Able to read in the voltage signals from the piezoelectric sensor in real-time
  - The voltage levels are currently quite small in the millivolt range so may have to amplify it in order to obtain a clear frequency spectrum 

### (4/16/2025)
- Learned how to control the sampling frequency of the ADC instead of polling as fast as possible
  - Now able to properly sample at 1024 Hz to eventually take the FFT
  - [STM32 ADC Sampling Frequency Guide](https://youtu.be/OePcprDTicU?si=xn8gZiH0Sa4o6Fy_)
- We can feed the output from the piezoelectric sensor into a constantly updated buffer of size 1024 to match the 1024 samples of the FFT

### (4/17/2025)
- Had 7th TA Meeting
  - Discussed progress made using the Dev board
    - Able to read in values from the piezoelectric sensor at a set sampling rate of 1024 Hz and store it in a buffer of size 1024 for the FFT
  - Prepare for the Mock Demo next TA meeting - the professor will also be there

### (4/18/2025)
- Completed Team Contract Assessment
- Began researching different FFT methods for the STM32 microcontroller
  - Can use the CMSIS library for built in FFT methods (https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_4/tree/master)
    - Most online guides still use CMSIS_4 so I'll dive deeper into that even though CMSIS_5 is available
  - Two possible functions for taking the FFT
    - arm_cfft_q15() + arm_cmplx_mag_q15()
      - Takes in the voltage signal buffer and outputs a complex buffer array which is then converted into its magnitude for the FFT
    - arm_rfft_fast_f32()
      - Takes in the voltage signal buffer and outputs a real and complex combined buffer that's twice the length of the input buffer
        - Ex. outputBuffer[0] is the real part and outputBuffer[1] is the complex part of the output
      - The magnitude is the manually taken via $mag[i] = \sqrt(outputBuffer[i]^2 + outputBuffer[i + 1]^2)$

## Week 14

### (4/22/2025)
- Can use STM32CubeMonitor to graphicallly visualize the input (Voltage vs Time) and output (Frequency Spectrum) buffers
- arm_cfft_q15() + arm_cmplx_mag_q15() method outputs some type of frequency spectrum but it does not appear to be correct
